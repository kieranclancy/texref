A quick reference utility for TeX and LaTeX which interprets
characters and their category codes etc., showing equivalent outputs etc.

At the moment it only has very basic functionality, but more types of
lookup may be added in future.

Note that the category code information for each character was collected
with LaTeX on my system, and I cannot guarantee that it is accurate with
all configurations (though it will be accurate on most).

If you want to fix something or add some features, patches are welcome!

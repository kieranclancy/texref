A quick reference utility for TeX and LaTeX which interprets
characters and their category codes etc., showing equivalent outputs etc.

It can either be used interactively, or from the command line where each
argument is treated as a line of input.

At the moment it only has very basic functionality, but more types of
lookup may be added in future.

Examples:
$ texref 11      # note, there are two outputs because it is ambiguous
Category code 11: Letter (a-zA-Z)
ASCII  <VT> ^K     "0x0b = '0013 =  11 cat: 15 Invalid (<DEL>)

$ texref {0..15} | grep ^CAT   # with expansion by bourne-style shell
CATCODE  0: Escape (\)
CATCODE  1: Begin group ({)
CATCODE  2: End group (})
...

$ texref {0..255} | grep 'cat: *10 '  # Get all chars with catcode 10
ASCII  <HT> ^I     "0x09 = '0011 =   9 cat: 10 Space
ASCII -> <- ^`     "0x20 = '0040 =  32 cat: 10 Space

$ texref
texref> help
help        Show this help message
quit        Quit the program
...
texref> a
ASCII ->a<- ^!     "0x61 = '0141 =  97 cat: 11 Letter (a-zA-Z)
texref> "0a
ASCII  <LF> ^J     "0x0a = '0012 =  10 cat: 12 Other
texref> '040
ASCII -> <- ^`     "0x20 = '0040 =  32 cat: 10 Space
texref> \c@t
ASCII ->\<- ^<FS>  "0x5c = '0134 =  92 cat:  0 Escape (\)
ASCII ->c<- ^#     "0x63 = '0143 =  99 cat: 11 Letter (a-zA-Z)
ASCII ->@<- ^<NUL> "0x40 = '0100 =  64 cat: 12 Other
ASCII ->t<- ^4     "0x74 = '0164 = 116 cat: 11 Letter (a-zA-Z)
texref> ...

Note that the category code information for each character was collected
with LaTeX on my system, and I cannot guarantee that it is accurate with
all configurations (though it will be accurate on most).

If you want to fix something or add some features, patches are welcome!
